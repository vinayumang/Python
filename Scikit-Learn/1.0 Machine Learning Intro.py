"""
 Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that 
 focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. 
 It involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computers to improve 
 their performance on a specific task over time without being explicitly programmed.
   
     Scikit-Learn is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced practitioners. Scikit-Learn supports various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
main uses of machine learning:

1. Predictive Analytics: Using historical data to make predictions about future events. 
2. Image and Speech Recognition: Identifying objects in images or transcribing spoken words into text. 
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyzing and understanding human language.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label.
Examples prediction of house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks,Random Forests.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The model is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns and relationships within the data on its own.
Examples customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior without predefined categories.
Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoders.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.  
Examples training an agent to play a game by rewarding it for achieving high scores.
Algorithms: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient Methods.
