#Scikit-Learn is a library used for machine learning in Python.
#commonly used functions in scikit learn are train_test_split, fit, predict, score

#Importing necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
