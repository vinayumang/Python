"""Introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVM) using Scikit-Learn.
 SVM is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.
 It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.
 
 SVM identifies the hyperplane that maximizes the distance to the nearest data points from each class, 
 known as the hard margin approach for linearly separable data. For non-linear data, kernel functions transform the 
 input space into a higher-dimensional one where separation becomes feasible
 Uses: 
- Text classification
- Image classification
- Bioinformatics (e.g., gene classification)
- Handwriting recognition
- Face detection

SVM Types:
- Linear SVM: Used for linearly separable data.
- Non-linear SVM: Uses kernel functions (like RBF, polynomial) to handle non-linear data.
