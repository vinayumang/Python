"""Unsupervised Learning with Scikit-Learn and Scipy are two powerful libraries in Python for performing unsupervised learning tasks. 
Unsupervised learning involves training models on data without labeled responses, allowing the model to identify patterns and structures within the data.
3 Main Types
Clustering
Groups similar data points
K-Means: Divides into K clusters (customer segments)
DBSCAN: Finds dense clusters any shape
Use: Market segmentation, image grouping

Association Rules
Finds "if A then B" patterns
Apriori: "Buy bread → buy butter" (market basket)
Use: Recommendation systems, retail

Dimensionality Reduction
Simplifies data (100 cols → 2 cols)
PCA: Compresses while keeping info
Use: Visualization, speed up models
